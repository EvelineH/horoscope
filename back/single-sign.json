        "prediction": "You may be a bit confused today, Taurus. More than likely, it will be hard for you to get an accurate read on your emotions. One of your automatic responses in situations like this is to turn to a close partner for advice. Unfortunately, this advice may throw you into even more of a tailspin."

        "sign":"Aquarius",
        "id":"10",
        "prediction": "Stick with what comes naturally, Aquarius. If something feels difficult or abrasive, this is a sign that your energy is better used elsewhere. But don't turn away until you're sure that what you're facing is actually a combative force."
